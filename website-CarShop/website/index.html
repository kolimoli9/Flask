        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Porsche Carrera GT</h2>
        <p class="lead">
         With its six-speed manual transmission and wooden cue-ball shift knob, it’s understandable why many call the Carrera GT the last of the analog supercars. 
          Absent the sophisticated safety systems of today’s latest-and-greatest, the mid-engined GT is a thrill-ride offering a taste of what might have been had Porsche set the GT’s sights on the racetrack.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          A 5.7-liter V-8 develops 603 hp and has a sound like no other Porsche engine ever made. The Carrera GT does not suffer fools, requiring skill when engaging its sensitive clutch and commanding respect when managing the rear-wheel horsepower.
           Its shape, the handiwork of Porsche’s then head designer Harm Lagaay, seems timeless—and almost understated—today. A total of 1,270 units were made between 2004 and 2007.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Ford GT</h2>
          <p mergin="right" >In 1966, lightning struck three times when Ford’s GT40 finished 1-2-3 at the daunting 24 Hours of Le Mans. 
            The first consumer grade GT40s came out of homologation rules that dictated equivalent road cars were built alongside the racers. 
            Fast forward to 2004, and Ford produced an homage to its famous competition machines, dubbing the supercharged sports car simply the GT.
          </p>
          <p >
            Though undeniably sexy, the new creation had no ostensible links to racing. Not until 2016, on the 50th anniversary of the Le Mans photo finish triple victory,
            did Ford venture down the GT road again, this time building a gorgeous twin-turbocharged game changer whose race equivalents won their LMGTE Pro class at Le Mans,
              completing a half-century circle with stunning symmetry.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Maserati MC12</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          A kissing cousin of the Ferrari Enzo, Maserati’s MC12 was built for the express purpose of competing in (and winning) the FIA GT Championship. 
          A total of 25 customer cars were made in 2004, with another 25 in 2005, each priced at $670,541, and all were presold. A final dozen were produced for racing only.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Frank Stephenson, then-director of Ferrari-Maserati Concept Design and Development penned the MC12, which was built on the Enzo chassis, 
          but was larger in every dimension. Sharing the Ferrari’s same 6.0-liter V-12 engine, the Maserati was deferential to its prancing horse patriarch, 
          making 621 hp and hitting 205 mph, versus 651 hp and 217 mph. While not street legal, the MC12 shines as one of the most voluptuous supercars of our century.

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Koenigsegg CCX</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Koenigsegg Automotive is the brainchild of Christian von Koenigsegg, whose Swedish atelier has been building wildly imaginative hypercars for the last quarter century.
         While early iterations were only street legal in limited markets (and built in extremely limited numbers), 2006’s CCX marked the carmaker’s first attempt to meet 
         global standards for safety and emissions.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Though only 29 examples of the CCX were produced over four years, the 800+ hp cars introduced the boutique brand to America, stoking a worldwide 
        appetite for these wildly innovative, carbon-fiber creations.

      <p class="lead">
        Achingly gorgeous. Aston Martin’s super-exclusive ONE-77 hypercar is a true art form. Just 77 of these potent projectiles were built, 
        each costing roughly $1.5 million. At its launch in 2009, this was the fastest, most technically-advanced, most radical Aston ever built. 
        And, arguably, the most beautiful.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        With a carbon-fiber chassis and hand-formed aluminum body, it was also light yet extremely rigid. And lightning quick, courtesy of its 750 hp, 7.3-liter V-12.
         How quick? Think zero to 60mph in 3.5 seconds and a 200 mph top speed. It’s the car Bond should be driving, but never has.

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Bugatti Veyron Super Sport</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Bugatti stormed back to the modern age from the pages of automotive history with the 2005 Veyron, which announced its intentions with quad-turbo twin-V8s
         that made an astonishing 1,200 hp. Fast forward a half-decade, and the Super Sport version of the Veyron promptly claimed the Guinness Book of Records title in 2010
          as world’s fastest production car with a 260 mph run at Volkswagen’s Wolfsburg test track.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        The Veyron Super Sport has been eclipsed by the 1,500 hp Bugatti Chiron Super Sport which, driven by Andy Wallace, recently hit 304 mph in testing. 
        However, nobody is apt to forget the Veyron—the machine that made the modern version of Bugatti what it is today.
